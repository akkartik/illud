Illud is a minimalist terminal text editor.

Features:
	- Insert mode.
	- Navigation mode.
	- Text wrapper.
	- Tab indication.

Usage:
	- ESC: Navigation mode.
	- i: Up.
	- k: Down.
	- j: Left.
	- l: Right.
	- s: Beginning of the line.
	- e: End of the line.
	- w: Write file.
	- f: Insert Mode.

Compatibility:
	- GNU/Linux: It works out of the box. Just clone the repository and run it.
	- macOS: I didn't test it on macOS, but since it is a unix-like OS, it also should work out of the box.
	- Windows: Install 'windows-curses' through 'pip' and everything will work.

TODO:
	- Syntax highlighting.
	- Jump to line.
	- Handle other keypresses so it doesn't print stuff like '<19a>'.
